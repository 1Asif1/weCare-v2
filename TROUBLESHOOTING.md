# Troubleshooting Guide - Face Recognition Issues

## Issue: Face Not Being Detected

### What I Fixed:
1. **Video Stream Ready State** - Added check to ensure video is fully loaded before detection
2. **Timing Issue** - Added 1-second delay after camera starts to allow video to stabilize
3. **Video Play State** - Ensured video element is playing before detection starts
4. **Better Error Logging** - Added console logs to help debug issues

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated `src/utils/faceRecognition.js`
- Modified `startVideo()` to wait for video metadata to load
- Ensures video is playing before returning

#### 2. Updated `src/components/FaceRegister.jsx`
- Added 1-second delay before starting face detection
- Added video readyState check (readyState === 4 means video is ready)
- Added better error messages

#### 3. Updated `src/components/FaceLogin.jsx`
- Applied same fixes as FaceRegister for consistency

## How to Test the Fix:

1. **Refresh the browser** (Ctrl + F5 to clear cache)
2. Click "Register with Face"
3. Fill in your details
4. Click "Start Camera"
5. Wait for the status to change from "Camera started..." to "No face detected..."
6. Position your face in the frame
7. You should see "Face detected! Ready to register." within a few seconds

## If Face Still Not Detected:

### Check Browser Console:
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for errors related to:
   - Model loading
   - Face detection
   - Video stream

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### Issue: Models Not Loading
**Symptoms:** Console shows 404 errors for model files
**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-download models
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File download-models.ps1
```

#### Issue: Video Not Playing
**Symptoms:** Video shows but is frozen
**Solution:**
- Refresh the page
- Check if another app is using the camera
- Try a different browser

#### Issue: Poor Lighting
**Symptoms:** Face detected intermittently
**Solution:**
- Improve room lighting
- Face a light source
- Avoid backlighting

#### Issue: Face Too Small/Large
**Symptoms:** No detection or intermittent detection
**Solution:**
- Move closer to camera (if too far)
- Move back from camera (if too close)
- Ensure face fills 30-70% of frame

#### Issue: Multiple Faces
**Symptoms:** Detection fails or inconsistent
**Solution:**
- Ensure only one face in frame
- Remove photos/posters with faces in background

#### Issue: Obstructions
**Symptoms:** No detection
**Solution:**
- Remove glasses (if causing issues)
- Remove face mask
- Ensure hair not covering face
- Face camera directly

## Debug Mode:

To see detailed detection info, open browser console (F12) and you'll see:
- "Face detected successfully" - when face is found
- "Detection error: [message]" - when detection fails
- Model loading status

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Browser console shows no errors
- [ ] All 9 model files exist in `public/models/`
- [ ] Camera permission granted
- [ ] Video stream is playing (not frozen)
- [ ] Good lighting conditions
- [ ] Face clearly visible
- [ ] Only one face in frame
- [ ] Face fills 30-70% of frame
- [ ] Status message updates in real-time

## Advanced Debugging:

### Check Video Element State:
Open console and type:
```javascript
// Check if video is playing
document.querySelector('video').paused  // Should be false
document.querySelector('video').readyState  // Should be 4
```

### Check Models Loaded:
```javascript
// In console after models load
console.log('Models loaded:', window.faceapi !== undefined)
```

### Manual Face Detection Test:
```javascript
// In console after camera starts
const video = document.querySelector('video');
faceapi.detectSingleFace(video, new faceapi.TinyFaceDetectorOptions())
  .withFaceLandmarks()
  .withFaceDescriptor()
  .then(detection => console.log('Manual detection:', detection));
```

## Performance Tips:

1. **Use Chrome or Edge** - Best WebGL support
2. **Close other tabs** - Reduce CPU/GPU load
3. **Good lighting** - Helps detection accuracy
4. **Stable position** - Don't move too much during detection
5. **Wait for "Face detected"** - Don't click Register too early

## Still Having Issues?

### Check These Files:
1. `public/models/` - All 9 files present?
2. Browser console - Any red errors?
3. Network tab - Models loading successfully?
4. Camera - Working in other apps?

### Try These Steps:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Try different browser
4. Restart computer
5. Check camera drivers updated

### Get More Help:
1. Take screenshot of browser console
2. Note exact error messages
3. Check which step fails:
   - Models loading?
   - Camera starting?
   - Face detection?
   - Registration?

## Expected Behavior:

### Successful Flow:
1. Click "Start Camera"
2. Status: "Starting camera..."
3. Status: "Camera started. Position your face in the frame."
4. (1 second delay)
5. Status: "No face detected. Please position your face clearly."
6. (Position face)
7. Status: "Face detected! Ready to register." ✓
8. Green badge appears: "Face Detected ✓"
9. Register button becomes enabled
10. Click Register → Success!

### Timeline:
- Models load: 2-5 seconds (first time)
- Camera start: 1-2 seconds
- Face detection: 0.5-2 seconds after positioning
- Total: ~5-10 seconds from start to ready

## Contact Support:

If none of these solutions work:
1. Document the exact steps you took
2. Screenshot any error messages
3. Note your browser and version
4. Check if camera works in other websites
5. Review the FACE_AUTH_SETUP.md for setup issues
